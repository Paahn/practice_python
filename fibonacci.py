# Write a program that asks the user how many
# Fibonnaci numbers to generate and then generates them.
# Take this opportunity to think about how you
# can use functions. Make sure to ask the user
# to enter the number of numbers in the sequence
# to generate.(Hint: The Fibonnaci seqence is a
# sequence of numbers where the next number in the
# sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers in
# the sequence. The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, â€¦)
